In this tutorial, we will go through an example of a bike shop. We will show the different capabilities of Redis Stack.


## Storing and managing JSON
Let's examine the query for creating a single bike:

```redis Create a bike
JSON.SET bikes:1 $ '{
    "model": "Hyperion", 
    "brand": "Velorim", 
    "price": 844, 
    "type": "Enduro bikes", 
    "specs": {
        "material": "full-carbon", 
        "weight": 8.7
    }, 
    "description": "This is a mid-travel trail slayer that is a fantastic daily driver or one bike quiver. At this price point, you get a Shimano 105 hydraulic groupset with a RS510 crank set. The wheels have had a slight upgrade for 2022, so you\'re now getting DT Swiss R470 rims with the Formula hubs. Put it all together and you get a bike that helps redefine what can be done for this price."
    }' 
```

You can use [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) to access any part of the stored JSON document:

```redis Get specific fields
JSON.GET bikes:1 $.model
JSON.GET bikes:1 $.specs.material
```

```redis Update specific fields
JSON.SET bikes:1 $.model '"Hyperion1"'
```

Now let's load a lot more bikes so we can play around with the queries:

```redis Load more bikes

## Indexing and querying
In addition to storing and managing JSON, Redis Stack provides the capability to index and query it. After we specify what we want to be indexed, the indexing happens automatically (and synchronously) when new data is saved.

```redis Create an index
FT.CREATE idx:bikes
 ON JSON 
    PREFIX 1 "bikes:"
 SCHEMA 
   $.model AS model TEXT NOSTEM SORTABLE 
   $.brand AS brand TEXT NOSTEM SORTABLE
   $.price AS price NUMERIC SORTABLE 
   $.type AS type TAG 
   $.specs.material AS material TAG
   $.specs.weight AS weight NUMERIC SORTABLE
   $.description as description TEXT
```

Now that we have our data indexed, it's really easy to run full-text searches on it and filter by number, tag and even geo position.

```redis Query by type
FT.SEARCH idx:bikes "@type:{eBikes}"
```

```redis Search by category and price
FT.SEARCH idx:bikes "@type:{eBikes} @price:[200 1200]" 
    RETURN 9 $.model AS model $.type AS type $.price AS price 
```

```redis Even more search parameters
FT.SEARCH idx:bikes "mudguards @type:{Mountain bikes} @price:[1000 3000]" 
    RETURN 12 $.model AS model $.type AS type $.price AS price $.description AS description
```

### Aggregate search
```redis Bike count per category
FT.AGGREGATE idx:bikes "@price:[1000 3000]" 
    GROUPBY 1 @type 
        REDUCE COUNT 0 AS count 
    SORTBY 2 @count "DESC"
```

```redis Average bike weight per category
FT.AGGREGATE idx:bikes "*" 
    GROUPBY 1 @type 
        REDUCE AVG 1 @weight AS average_bike_weight 
    SORTBY 2 @average_bike_weight "DESC"
```

```redis Bikes per weight range
FT.AGGREGATE idx:bikes "*"
    APPLY "floor(@weight)" AS weight
    GROUPBY 1 @weight
      REDUCE count 0 AS count
    SORTBY 1 @weight
```
